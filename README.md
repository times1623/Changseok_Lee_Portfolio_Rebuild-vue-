# Hi, this is my Portfolio
The main concepts and ideas when I started to build this 5 different web pages were showing an visible iconic graphics that captures the essence of my achievement that I've been through so far and showing where I will be in the future as well.

As I said before, its divided into 5 different sections.
And This is going to be a main one that people will experience first time on my website.

Like the simplified auto-biography, it shows a brief information about me like,
who am I, what I've done so far, what's my ability or skills I have and I could confidently say.
Below that, it shows my most recent work and some others.
This is a main page of my portfolio website.

# Case Study Information
Each portfolio works needs to have organized explanation to help potential users to understand about
the entire process of how I start that project from the draft and how I ended that up.
Thus, each of those pages has well-organized and detailed information and explanation about itself.
